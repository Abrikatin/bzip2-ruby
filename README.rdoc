= Ruby C bindings to libbzip2

== Installation

 sudo gem install brianmario-bzip2-ruby -s http://gems.github.com/
 
You may need to specify:

 --with-bz2-dir=<include file directory for libbzip2>

== TODO

* 1.9 compatibility - I could use some help with this as I think it's gonna require some Makefile trickery
